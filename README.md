# Software-Defined-Networking-SDN-with-OpenFlow
A simple SDN project using the Ryu controller and Mininet. Implements reactive MAC-learning, installs OpenFlow 1.3 flow rules, and forwards packets dynamically. Tested on a single-switch topology with connectivity checks and Wireshark OpenFlow packet capture.
